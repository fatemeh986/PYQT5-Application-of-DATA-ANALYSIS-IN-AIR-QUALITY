# DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING A DATA ANALYSIS IN AIR QUALITY IN PYQT5 2023
In this project python3.10.12 and pyqt5.15.10 were used.

The primary goal of this project is "Analyzing and Visualizing changes in NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 data worldwide​".
The data is free on WHO website to download. "WHO Air Quality Database (Updated 2022)​"
For the map I used API.

For some reasons I deleted the image processing and object detection parts, so those parts don't work.

In the below images you can see the tabs of the application.
